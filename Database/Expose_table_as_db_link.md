## Safely Exposing Data Using Oracle DB Link

When sharing data between Oracle databases, security and access control are critical. Here’s a step-by-step approach to safely expose data using a database link:

### 1. Create a Dedicated Schema for Data Exposure
Instead of exposing your core tables directly, create a new schema (user) specifically for sharing data. This limits the blast radius if credentials are leaked.

```sql
CREATE USER data_share IDENTIFIED BY strong_password;
```

### 2. Grant Only Relevant Privileges
Grant only the necessary privileges to the new schema. For read-only access, grant only `CREATE SESSION` and `SELECT` on required objects.

```sql
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO data_share;
GRANT SELECT ON main_schema.important_table TO data_share;
```

### 3. Whitelist Source Server for DB Link Access
Restrict which remote servers can connect via the DB link by configuring network ACLs or firewall rules. In Oracle, use `DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN` to allow only trusted hosts.

```sql
BEGIN
	DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.ADD_PRIVILEGE(
		acl         => 'db_link_acl.xml',
		principal   => 'data_share',
		is_grant    => TRUE,
		privilege   => 'connect',
		start_date  => NULL,
		end_date    => NULL
	);
END;
```

### 4. Create a View for Read Operations
Expose only the required columns and rows by creating a view in the new schema.

```sql
CREATE VIEW data_share.vw_important_data AS
SELECT col1, col2 FROM main_schema.important_table WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### 5. Create a Synonym for the View
Make it easier for remote users to reference the view by creating a synonym.

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM data_share.important_data FOR data_share.vw_important_data;
```

### 6. Grant Read Access on the View to Specific Schemas
Grant `SELECT` on the view to only those schemas/users that need access.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON data_share.vw_important_data TO remote_user;
```

### 7. Create the Database Link in the Source Database
On the source (remote) database, create the DB link using the credentials of the dedicated schema.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK data_share_link
CONNECT TO data_share IDENTIFIED BY strong_password
USING 'target_db_tns';
```

### 8. Query the Data Safely
Remote users can now query the exposed view via the DB link:

```sql
SELECT * FROM important_data@data_share_link;
```

**Summary:**
By following these steps—creating a dedicated schema, granting only necessary privileges, whitelisting source servers, and exposing data via views and synonyms—you can safely share data between Oracle databases while minimizing security risks.
